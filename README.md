# React Hooks tests

This repo was built as a test for the speed of react hooks vs traditional react architecture

It uses puppeteer, and an app generated using create-react-app.

## Running the speed tests

install all of the dependencies using `npm i`

start the development server for the react app `npm start`

run the tests and watch the speed reports in the console `node puppeteer_speed_test.js`
